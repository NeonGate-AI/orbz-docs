# Core Web Vitals optimization

Targeted optimization for the three Core Web Vitals using field data to identify user impact and browser traces to diagnose causes.

## Orbz Docs repository policy

Core Web Vitals are field metrics, not source-code properties. Target Google's current “Good” thresholds at the 75th percentile: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms and CLS ≤ 0.1. Source audits and lab traces are diagnostic evidence only; they must not be reported as production p75 results.

For this Nextra site, optimize the server-first content path, avoid unnecessary Client Components, preserve stable geometry around the Orbz custom element/examples, and treat search/theme/client registration code as interaction and bundle-budget surfaces.

## Measure before optimizing

1. Define route, state, viewport/device class and expected primary content.
2. Check existing field evidence first (CrUX/Search Console/RUM) when available and record its URL/origin scope, time window and percentile.
3. Use source inspection and browser traces/lab tools to diagnose resource discovery, main-thread work, event latency and layout movement.
4. Apply the narrowest fix supported by evidence, then repeat the same lab conditions.
5. Validate production impact with field data when making a Core Web Vitals pass/improvement claim.

Use [the performance measurement workflow](../performance/references/MEASUREMENT.md) for detailed diagnostic procedures and keep field and lab samples explicitly separate.

## The three metrics

| Metric | Measures | Good | Needs work | Poor |
|--------|----------|------|------------|------|
| **LCP** | Loading | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5s – 4s | > 4s |
| **INP** | Interactivity | ≤ 200ms | 200ms – 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** | Visual Stability | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 – 0.25 | > 0.25 |

Google measures at the **75th percentile** — 75% of page visits must meet "Good" thresholds.

## LCP: Largest Contentful Paint

LCP measures when the largest visible content element renders. Usually this is:
- Hero image or video
- Large text block
- Background image
- `<svg>` element

### Common LCP issues

**1. Slow server response (TTFB > 800ms)**
```
Fix: CDN, caching, optimized backend, edge rendering
```

**2. Render-blocking resources**
```html
<!-- ❌ Blocks rendering -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/all-styles.css">

<!-- ✅ Critical CSS inlined, rest deferred -->
<style>/* Critical above-fold CSS */</style>
<link rel="preload" href="/styles.css" as="style"
      onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
```

**3. Slow resource load times**
```html
<!-- ❌ LCP image is discovered only after a stylesheet loads -->
<div class="hero"></div>

<!-- ✅ Discoverable in initial HTML and prioritized -->
<link rel="preload" href="/hero.webp" as="image" fetchpriority="high">
<img src="/hero.webp" alt="Hero" fetchpriority="high">
```

Prefer a discoverable `<img>` with `fetchpriority="high"`. Add the preload only when the trace shows that the resource would otherwise be discovered late; duplicate or speculative preloads can compete for bandwidth.

**4. Client-side rendering delays**
```javascript
// ❌ Content loads after JavaScript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/hero-text').then(r => r.json()).then(setHeroText);
}, []);

// ✅ Server-side or static rendering
// Use SSR, SSG, or streaming to send HTML with content
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const heroText = await fetchHeroText();
  return { props: { heroText } };
}
```

**5. Make navigations instant with the Speculation Rules API**

For sites with predictable same-origin journeys, prerendering a likely next page can make a successful subsequent navigation much faster. Treat this as a measured navigation optimization, not a substitute for fixing the current page's LCP.

```html
<script type="speculationrules">
{
  "prerender": [{
    "where": { "href_matches": "/*" },
    "eagerness": "moderate"
  }]
}
</script>
```

Current Chrome behavior is specific enough to guide the choice:

| `eagerness` | Trigger |
|-------------|---------|
| `conservative` | Pointer or touch down |
| `moderate` | Desktop: 200ms hover, or earlier pointer down; mobile: viewport heuristics |
| `eager` | Chrome 143+: desktop 10ms hover; mobile 50ms after the anchor enters the viewport |
| `immediate` | As soon as the rules are observed |

Start conservatively and measure prediction hit rate, transferred bytes, server load, and navigation improvement before expanding the rules. Recheck [Chrome's maintained eagerness documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/prerender-pages#eagerness) before hardcoding timing-sensitive behavior.

Caveats:
- **Bandwidth/CPU cost.** Each prerender is roughly a full page load. Scope `where` carefully (`href_matches` patterns, exclude logout/checkout) and avoid `immediate` outside small sites.
- **Side effects fire early.** Analytics, ads, and any code that runs on load will fire when the prerender starts, not when the user navigates. Gate side effects on the [`prerenderingchange` event](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/prerender-pages#detect_when_a_page_is_prerendered_or_used_for_a_full_navigation) or `document.prerendering`.
- **Chromium-only.** Safari and Firefox ignore the script — it's a progressive enhancement, never a regression.

### LCP optimization checklist

```markdown
- [ ] TTFB < 800ms (use CDN, edge caching)
- [ ] LCP resource is discoverable in initial HTML and prioritized; preload only if the trace shows late discovery
- [ ] LCP image optimized (WebP/AVIF, correct size)
- [ ] Critical CSS inlined (< 14KB)
- [ ] No render-blocking JavaScript in <head>
- [ ] Fonts don't block text rendering (font-display: swap)
- [ ] LCP element in initial HTML (not JS-rendered)
- [ ] Speculation Rules added for likely-next navigations (moderate eagerness)
```

### LCP element identification

This snippet diagnoses the current page session. It is not field data.

```javascript
// Find your LCP element
new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  const lastEntry = entries[entries.length - 1];
  console.log('LCP element:', lastEntry.element);
  console.log('LCP time:', lastEntry.startTime);
}).observe({ type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true });
```

## INP: Interaction to Next Paint

INP measures responsiveness across clicks, taps, and key presses during a visit. Diagnose its input delay, processing time, and presentation delay separately; a slow interaction may involve main-thread contention before the handler, expensive application work, or delayed rendering after it.

When field INP is poor or a trace identifies a slow interaction, read [the INP reference](references/INP.md) for trace interpretation, yielding patterns, third-party and rendering causes, a single-session observer, and first-party attribution.

---

## CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift

CLS measures unexpected layout shifts across a page visit. Use field attribution or a trace to identify the shifted node and the trigger; do not assume the visible victim caused the shift.

When field CLS is poor or a trace reports shifts, read [the CLS reference](references/CLS.md) for reserved-space patterns, dynamic content, font and animation fixes, a debugging observer, and a verification checklist.

---

## Evidence hierarchy

| Source | What it can establish |
|---|---|
| `.audits/` and source inspection | Deterministic repository contracts and risk patterns, not metric values |
| Local/browser lab traces | Reproducible diagnosis under stated conditions |
| Lighthouse/PageSpeed lab output | Synthetic audit evidence for the tested environment |
| CrUX/Search Console/RUM | Real-user field evidence when scope, period and percentile are known |

Never compare a single lab value directly with a field p75 as if they were equivalent samples. Keep before/after conditions stable and cite the evidence source with every quantitative claim.

## Framework quick fixes

### Next.js
```jsx
// LCP: Use next/image with priority
import Image from 'next/image';
<Image src="/hero.jpg" priority fill alt="Hero" />

// INP: Use dynamic imports
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./Heavy'), { ssr: false });

// CLS: Image component handles dimensions automatically
```

### React
```jsx
// LCP: Preload in head
<link rel="preload" href="/hero.jpg" as="image" fetchpriority="high" />

// INP: Memoize and useTransition
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(() => setExpensiveState(newValue));

// CLS: Always specify dimensions in img tags
```

### Vue/Nuxt
```vue
<!-- LCP: Use nuxt/image with preload -->
<NuxtImg src="/hero.jpg" preload loading="eager" />

<!-- INP: Use async components -->
<component :is="() => import('./Heavy.vue')" />

<!-- CLS: Use aspect-ratio CSS -->
<img :style="{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }" />
```
