# Web quality audit

Comprehensive quality review that combines live browser evidence with source inspection. Covers Performance, Accessibility, SEO, Best Practices, and Agentic Browsing without treating an aggregate score as proof of quality.

## Orbz Docs repository policy

Audit this repository as a public Nextra documentation site. WCAG 2.2 AA, technical SEO/crawlability and Core Web Vitals field thresholds are durable targets, but the evidence needed for each target differs. Static checks may prove source contracts; browser tools may prove lab behavior; field data is required for production CWV claims; manual assistive-technology work is required for claims automation cannot establish.

Do not collapse Performance, Accessibility, SEO, Best Practices or Agentic Browsing into one synthetic quality claim. Never invent scores, indexing outcomes, rankings, WCAG conformance or production metric improvements.

## How it works

1. Establish representative public routes and important states, including mobile/desktop and light/dark theme where relevant.
2. Load the active spec, applicable rules and the smallest source/content surface.
3. Run `pnpm harness:check` for deterministic architecture/content/SEO wiring checks.
4. Inspect rendered semantics, search, navigation, Orbz examples, assets and interaction behavior. Use browser/lab tools when available and justified by the spec.
5. Compare findings against source contracts and, when available, production Search Console/CrUX/RUM evidence.
6. Classify each finding by severity, confidence and evidence class; propose the smallest durable fix.
7. Re-run the exact relevant checks after changes and state what remains unverified.

## Tool routing

| Need | Primary route | Required caution |
|---|---|---|
| Harness/content correctness | `.audits/*.audit.sh`, Biome, TypeScript, production build | Static checks do not establish runtime conformance |
| Performance diagnosis | DevTools trace/Lighthouse/PageSpeed when available | Record route/device/conditions; lab ≠ field p75 |
| Real-user performance | CrUX, Search Console CWV, approved RUM | Record URL/origin scope and period |
| Accessibility | Semantic source review + axe/Lighthouse where available + manual keyboard/screen reader | Automated pass ≠ WCAG conformance |
| SEO | Rendered metadata, status/redirects, robots, sitemap, canonical, structured data, Search Console | Crawlability/indexability ≠ ranking guarantee |
| Agentic browsing | Semantic/accessibility tree and explicit machine-facing interfaces when actually supported | Keep separate from ranking/AI-citation claims |

## Audit categories

### Performance

**Core Web Vitals** — Must pass for good page experience:
* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s.** The largest visible element must render quickly. Optimize images, fonts, and server response time.
* **INP (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms.** User interactions must feel instant. Reduce JavaScript execution time and break up long tasks.
* **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1.** Content must not jump around. Set explicit dimensions on images, embeds, and ads.

**Resource Optimization:**
* **Compress images.** Use WebP/AVIF with fallbacks. Serve correctly sized images via `srcset`.
* **Minimize JavaScript.** Remove unused code. Use code splitting. Defer non-critical scripts.
* **Optimize CSS.** Extract critical CSS. Remove unused styles. Avoid `@import`.
* **Efficient fonts.** Use `font-display: swap`. Preload critical fonts. Subset to needed characters.

**Loading Strategy:**
* **Preconnect to origins.** Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for third-party domains.
* **Preload critical assets.** LCP images, fonts, and above-fold CSS.
* **Lazy load below-fold content.** Images, iframes, and heavy components.
* **Cache effectively.** Long cache TTLs for static assets. Immutable caching for hashed files.

### Accessibility

**Perceivable:**
* **Text alternatives.** Every `<img>` has meaningful `alt` text. Decorative images use `alt=""`.
* **Color contrast.** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
* **Don't rely on color alone.** Use icons, patterns, or text alongside color indicators.
* **Captions and transcripts.** Video has captions. Audio has transcripts.

**Operable:**
* **Keyboard accessible.** All functionality available via keyboard. No keyboard traps.
* **Focus visible.** Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements.
* **Skip links.** Provide "Skip to main content" for keyboard users.
* **Sufficient time.** Users can extend time limits. No auto-advancing content without controls.

**Understandable:**
* **Page language.** Set `lang` attribute on `<html>`.
* **Consistent navigation.** Same navigation structure across pages.
* **Error identification.** Form errors clearly described and associated with fields.
* **Labels and instructions.** All form inputs have associated labels.

**Robust:**
* **Valid HTML.** No duplicate IDs. Properly nested elements.
* **ARIA used correctly.** Prefer native elements. ARIA roles match behavior.
* **Name, role, value.** Interactive elements have accessible names and correct roles.

### SEO

**Crawlability:**
* **Valid robots.txt.** Doesn't block important resources.
* **XML sitemap.** Lists all important pages. Submitted to Search Console.
* **Canonical URLs.** Prevent duplicate content issues.
* **No noindex on important pages.** Check meta robots and headers.

**On-Page SEO:**
* **Unique title tags.** Make each title descriptive and concise; display truncation varies by device and result type.
* **Meta descriptions.** Write useful, page-specific summaries; search engines may choose a different snippet.
* **Heading hierarchy.** The primary heading is descriptive and the structure is logical; do not fail valid HTML solely for using more than one `<h1>`.
* **Descriptive link text.** Not "click here" or "read more".

**Technical SEO:**
* **Mobile-friendly.** Responsive design. Apply the 24×24 CSS-pixel WCAG 2.5.8 minimum with its defined exceptions and a larger practical touch target where appropriate.
* **HTTPS.** Secure connection required.
* **Page experience signals.** Use field Core Web Vitals as evidence, without promising a ranking change.
* **Structured data.** JSON-LD for rich snippets (Article, Product, FAQ, etc.).

### Best practices

**Security:**
* **HTTPS everywhere.** No mixed content. HSTS enabled.
* **No vulnerable libraries.** Keep dependencies updated.
* **CSP headers.** Content Security Policy to prevent XSS.
* **No exposed source maps.** In production builds.

**Modern Standards:**
* **No deprecated APIs.** Replace `document.write`, synchronous XHR, etc.
* **Valid doctype.** Use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
* **Charset declared.** `<meta charset="UTF-8">` as first element in `<head>`.
* **No browser errors.** Clean console. No CORS issues.

**UX Patterns:**
* **No intrusive interstitials.** Especially on mobile.
* **Clear permission requests.** Only ask when needed, with context.
* **No misleading buttons.** Buttons do what they say.

### Agentic browsing

In the current phase, inspect semantic HTML, labels, names, roles, states, and deterministic interaction contracts statically and manually as signals for how well assistants can understand and interact with the rendered page. If the owner later re-enables Lighthouse Agentic Browsing, keep its results separate as automated technical evidence rather than treating them as authority.

* **Accessible interaction surface.** Semantic HTML, labels, names, roles, and states must expose meaningful controls in the accessibility tree.
* **WebMCP integrations are valid when present.** Review registered tools, schemas, and form coverage; do not add WebMCP solely to raise an audit score.
* **`llms.txt` is optional.** A valid file may help compatible tools discover curated content, but a Lighthouse pass does not prove that search or AI products will ingest, rank, or cite it.
* **Keep this category separate from SEO claims.** Agentic browsability is not evidence of search ranking or AI visibility.
